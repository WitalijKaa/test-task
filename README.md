- architecture
- JavaScript
- BEM Html Css
- frontend
- OOP

Create SPA to edit users:

- table with users data, edit and remove buttons
- new user inputs, validation
- do not use any libraries or frameworks

Plus mini task: canvas with stars that can detect star color by click.

## comments

I had implemented some base architecture that looks like BackboneJS and VueJS.

I like that validator is very separate and Human-model is thin.
